# Epic Gamer Time project

This was a group project given during the second semester of my second year in the BIT at Otago Polytech. I worked on it with 4 others: Heather
McDonald, Jayden Caldwell, Joel Glasgow and Gabriel Avis. We were required to do some work on each aspect of the site including, controllers, views,
models, etc. As well as front end coding.

Note: This repo is not the one we used during development.
